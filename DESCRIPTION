Description: Provides a comprehensive database of glycan structures from GlyTouCan,
    including fully determined glycan structures with complete linkage, substituent,
    anomer, and monosaccharide information. The package contains curated datasets
    derived from GlyTouCan v2.9.1 release, offering both fully determined structures
    and topology-only versions. This database serves as a foundational resource
    for the glycoverse ecosystem, enabling glycan structure analysis, comparison,
    and research applications.
